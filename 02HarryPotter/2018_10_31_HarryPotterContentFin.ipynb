      "about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in\n",
      "funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this\n",
      "was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering\n",

      "close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was\n",
